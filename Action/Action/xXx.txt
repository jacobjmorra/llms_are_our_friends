* LLMs to interesting recommendation algorithms 
* A lot of the current recommendation algorithms are older

* Currently, tie between screenplay and genre network is the strongest
* tying back to reviews: once you get LLMs to look at enough reviews, can it predict which outlet the review came from, or
